## Description
Code Quiz is a timed coding quiz with scores stored locally. Scores are stored with corresponding initials.

## Features
​
* Users can take the quiz and retry seamlessly.
* Score is linked to the timer, which will decrease by a set increment on any incorrect answers.
* Users can store their scores with their initials and scores will persist between sessions unless cleared.
* Users can view high scores in a modal with the click of a button and clear the scores if they so choose with another click.
​
## Future Buildout
​
Currently an error is thrown in the console anytime anything other than an answer choice is clicked. This does not affect user functionality but in a future build this should be eliminated. Additionally, a future build will limit the high scores displayed to 5 and will parse and order them by score.
